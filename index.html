                    <h2><b>About me!</b></h2>
                    <p>My name is <b>Ruhan Cillers</b> and I am 22 years old. I was born in England and moved to South
                        Africa when I was very young. I have developed a passion for coding through my experience at
                        HyperionDev and hope to become an invaluable member of any team I have the privilege of joining.
                        Some of my hobbies include gaming, surfing, and enjoying good food. I enjoy working with people who
                        can teach me how to improve in my job and career.</p>
                    <p>The desire to be useful in any situation I am in motivates me to be the best version of myself I can be.
                        I am also motivated by a desire to ensure that my work goes above and beyond what was expected of me.
                    </p>
                    <p>One day I hope that with my experience one day I can code a product that can help everyone struggling
                        with self-management due to external or internal pressures. I personally have struggled with these issues
                        and know it can be difficult to move forward; however, with this product, hopefully, their next step in
                        life becomes slightly easier!</p>
